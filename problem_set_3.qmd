## Question 1

Suppose I want to examine the hypothesis that consuming political news coverage from cable network channels (e.g., CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, etc.) causes citizens to have less trust in government than if they were to consume it from mainstream print media (e.g., New York Times, Wall Street Journal, etc.). What is more, suppose that I believe that this effect is greatest among “young” citizens. Design the contours of an experiment to test this proposition (and be sure to sketch the key elements of the experimental design). Second, briefly describe any significant shortcomings that the experimental design might have.

## Question 2

Below are four hypothetical research designs to determine the effects of democratic governance on the funding of educational institutions. Briefly evaluate each sampling design in terms of its: (1) sampling variability and (2) sources of potential bias.

*Points: 10*

A.    A sample of educational funding levels for every country in Europe for each of the last 100 years.

B.    A sample of educational funding levels in five randomly picked countries drawn from the global population of countries for each of the last 10 years.

C.    A survey of educational administrators that yields responses that allow for a comparison of educational funding levels in Russia and the United States for the six-year period from 2010 to 2015.

D.    A sample of 75 randomly selected countries’ educational funding levels for each of the past 25 years.

## Question 3

Using the `hanmerKalkanANES` dataset (posted on Elms), construct a cross-tab with `presvote` (dichotomous variable coded with a value label) as the dependent variable and `ageCategorical` (1 = 18-30; 2 = 31-40; 3 = 41-50; 4 = 51-60; and 5 = 61-over) as the independent variable. Create a table with the cross-tab results and interpret them – i.e., what is the apparent association, if any, between age and U.S. presidential vote in 2004? Next, what is: (A) the conditional distribution of respondents who are 41-50 that voted for Kerry; and (B) the conditional distribution of respondents who are 41-50 that voted for Bush?
