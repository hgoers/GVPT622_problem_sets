## Question 1

Use the data in the table below to answer the following questions.

*Points: 6*

```{r}
#| echo: false

tibble::tibble(
  `Age group` = c("18-24", "25-30", "31 and up", "TOTAL"),
  `Non-voters` = c(70, 40, 220, 330),
  Voters = c(50, 50, 570, 670),
  Total = `Non-voters` + Voters
) |> 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Voting by Age in 2000")
```

### Part A

What is the probability of being 25-30 or a non-voter?

*Points: 2*

### Part B

Assuming a normal distribution, report the 95% confidence intervals for the percentage of 18-to-24-year-olds who did not vote, and then the percentage of 25-to-30-year-olds who did not vote.

*Points: 4*

## Question 2

Assume that the standard deviation for the population distribution of a state in which you want to conduct a poll is 200.

### Part A

Calculate the spread of the sampling distribution for each of the following sample sizes: 1, 4, 25, 100, 250, 1000, 5,000, and 10,000.

*Points: 3*

### Part B

Describe specifically how the variability of the sampling distribution changes as the sample size varies. Considering the expense of running a poll, which sample size do you think is most optimal if conducting the poll?

*Points: 1*

### Part C

Display your results graphically (using R) with the sample size on the x-axis and the standard error (of the sampling distribution) on the y-axis.

*Points: 3*

## Question 3

Suppose you conduct a survey (to generate a sample mean of interest) and find that it has a margin of error of 4.5 with a sample size of 900 using a 95% confidence interval. What would the margin of error be for a 90% confidence interval?

*Points: 4*

## Question 4

Assume that, in State A, the mean income in the population is \$20,000 with a standard deviation of \$2,000. If you took an SRS of 900 individuals from that population, what is the probability that you would get a sample mean income of \$20,200 or greater? What would be the probability if the sample size was only 25? (Assume a normal distribution for both questions.)

*Points: 4*

## Question 5

Assume that a coin is fair. If I flip a coin 500 times, what is a 95% confidence interval for the range of the count of heads that I will get? What if I flip the coin 5,000 times? What about 50,000 times?

*Points: 4*
